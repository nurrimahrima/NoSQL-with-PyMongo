# NoSQL-with-PyMongo

**NoSQL**<br>
NoSQL originally referring to non SQL or non relational is a database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data. This data is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. NoSQL databases are used in real-time web applications and big data and their use are increasing over time.

**Why NoSQL?**<br>
1. In recent times you can easily capture and access data from various sources, like Facebook, Google, etc.
2. Userâ€™s personal information, geographic location data, user generated content, social graphs and machine logging data are some of the examples where data is increasing rapidly.
3. To use above mentioned properties, it is necessary to process large volume of data.
4. For which relational databases are not suitable. The evolution of NoSQL databases is to handle this large volume of data properly.

**Use of NoSQL**<br>
1. Storage
2. Mobile Application
3. Third-Party Data Aggregation
4. IoT (Internet of Things)
5. E-Commerce
6. Social Gaming
7. Ad Targeting
8. etc

**Advantages of NoSQL**<br>
- NOSQL provides high level of scalability.
- It is used in distributed computing environment.
- Implementation is less costly,it provides storage for semi-structured data, and it is also provide flexibility in schema.
- Relationships are less complicated
- Large volumes of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
- Object-oriented algorithms permit implementations in order to achieve the maximum availability over multiple data centers.
- Eventual-consistency based systems scale update workloads better than traditional OLAP RDBMS, while also scaling to very large datasets.
- Programming that is easy to use and flexible. Efficient, scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture

**MongoDB**<br>
MongoDB is a document-oriented, open-source database program that is platform-independent. MongoDB, like some other NoSQL databases, stores its data in documents using a JSON structure. This is what allows the data to be so flexible and not require a schema.
